description: "Le Cousin Pons (French pronunciation: ​[lə kuzɛ̃ pɔ̃s]) is one of the\
  \ last of the 94 works of Honoré de Balzac’s Comédie humaine, which are in both\
  \ novel and short story form. Begun in 1846 as a novella, or long-short story, it\
  \ was envisaged as one part of a diptych, Les Parents pauvres (The Poor Relations),\
  \ the other part of which was La Cousine Bette (Cousin Bette). The book was originally\
  \ published as a serial in Le Constitutionnel.\nThe novella grew in 1847 into a\
  \ full-length novel with a male poor relation, Pons, as its subject, whereas La\
  \ Cousine Bette describes the female aspect of that subordinate relationship. The\
  \ two novels were thus similar yet diametrically different. They were complementary,\
  \ forming two parts of a whole.\nLe Cousin Pons has been classified by Balzac as\
  \ the second Episode of Les Parents pauvres, the first Episode being La Cousine\
  \ Bette. Especially admired by Paul Bourget, it is one of the very greatest of his\
  \ novels.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
